      <h1 style="font-size: 0.5vw; font-family: fantasy;" > The shadow of the dome of pleasure<br/>
        Floated midway on the waves;<br/>
        Where was heard the mingled measure<br/>
        From the fountain and the caves.<br/>
        It was a miracle of rare device,<br/>
        A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<br/>
        
        A damsel with a dulcimer<br/>
        In a vision once I saw:<br/>
        It was an Abyssinian maid<br/>
        And on her dulcimer she play'd,<br/>
        Singing of Mount Abora.<br/>
        Could I revive within me<br/>
        Her symphony and song,<br/>
        To such a deep delight 'twould win me </h1>
